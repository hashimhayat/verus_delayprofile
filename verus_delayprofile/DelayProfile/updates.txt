Updates Required:

1/ Smooth First n Values: Init delays should be low: Can use next values

2/ Update delay profile for large incoming values (outliers)

3/ Test in real time situation: Update a[i] SmotthArr and Curve Simultaniously

(*) 4/ Compute Curve in O[i] 

5/ find delay/window for values where the curve does not start

(IMP) 6/ There are empty values in the wList, put an estimated value in the smoothArray for proper updation.
